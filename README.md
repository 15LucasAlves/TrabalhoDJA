## 🧩 Description

## 💡 One-Tweet Concept

> "Fighting bosses and enemies, perks gained by gambling, good or bad, we will never know."

Each boss you defeat offers a risky choice: gamble their soul for potential power or face consequences if you lose, or skip the gamble and lose the soul forever.

## 📜 Main Story

The player awakens cursed in **Dranft**, a decaying coastal village consumed by myth and greed. After entering a ruined shack tied to local witch legends, they are bound to an ancient gambling ritual.  

To break free, they must defeat six cursed guardians and gamble their souls. The twist? The witch was not the source of the curse, but its final victim.

The journey ends in a buried chamber beneath the town, where fate itself is dealt like a card game. In the final gamble, the player must choose:  
- Break the cycle, sacrificing all progress.  
- Keep their power, and risk becoming the next cursed dealer.

Multiple endings depend on player choices, how many souls were gambled, skipped, or stolen.
